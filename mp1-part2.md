# MP1 Part 2: Build a Data Loaders Module

Continue working in the same `mp1-data-pipeline` repository from Part 1.

In Part 2, you will extend your command-line pipeline by adding a separate module for loading different data file formats. Your pipeline will now load the input file after validating it.

## Project Structure

At the end of Part 2, your repository should contain:

```text
mp1-data-pipeline/
├── .gitignore
├── pipeline.py         (updated)
├── data_loaders.py     (new)
├── requirements.txt    (new)
└── fixtures/           (new)
    ├── sample.csv
    ├── sample.json
    └── sample.yaml
```

* `pipeline.py` — update your existing pipeline to use the data loaders.
* `data_loaders.py` — new module containing functions for loading different file formats.
* `fixtures/` — new directory containing sample files for testing.
    * These are small files used to test your data loaders, so do not add `fixtures/` to `.gitignore`. Make sure to git add and commit them.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to your existing repository:

```bash
cd mp1-data-pipeline
```

2. Set up and activate a virtual environment as practiced in class:

**Note:** We will cover virtual environments on Friday. You may skip this section for now and return to it after class.

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required packages and create `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install pandas pyyaml
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Make sure `venv/` is included in `.gitignore`. Do not add `requirements.txt` to `.gitignore`.


3. Make sure your Part 1 work is committed:

```bash
git status
```

4. Create a feature branch for Part 2:

```bash
git switch -c feature/data-loaders
```

5. Create the following new files:

```text
data_loaders.py
fixtures/sample.csv
fixtures/sample.json
fixtures/sample.yaml
```

Reuse the sample files from your Class 4 exercise. Copy them into `fixtures/` and rename them as follows:

| Class 4 file | Part 2 fixture |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `data/sample.csv` | `fixtures/sample.csv` |
| `data/sample.json` | `fixtures/sample.json` |
| `data/sample.yaml` | `fixtures/sample.yaml` |


## Starter Code

```python
# data_loaders.py
from pathlib import Path

import logging
import pandas as pd
import json
import yaml


# Do not call logging.basicConfig() here.
# Use the logging configuration from Part 1.
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def load_csv(filepath):
    """Load a CSV file into a DataFrame."""
    pass


def load_json(filepath):
    """Load a JSON file into a Python object (dict or list)."""
    pass


def load_yaml(filepath):
    """Load a YAML file into a Python object."""
    pass


def load_data(filepath):
    """Load a file based on its extension."""
    pass
```


## Required Functions

### 1. `load_csv(filepath)`

Load a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

Requirements:

* Use `pd.read_csv()`.
* Log an `INFO` message after successfully loading the file.
* Include the number of rows in the log message.
* Return the DataFrame.

Example:

```text
INFO     Loaded CSV file: fixtures/sample.csv (5 rows)
```

### 2. `load_json(filepath)`

Load a JSON file — the same way you'd parse a typical API response.

Requirements:

* Use `json.load()`.
* Log an `INFO` message after successfully loading the file.
* Return the resulting Python object (e.g. dictionary).

Example:

```text
INFO     Loaded JSON file: fixtures/sample.json
```

### 3. `load_yaml(filepath)`

Load a YAML file into a Python object.

Requirements:

* Use `yaml.safe_load()`.
* Log an `INFO` message after successfully loading the file.
* Return the resulting Python object (e.g. dictionary)

Example:

```text
INFO     Loaded YAML file: fixtures/sample.yaml
```

### 4. `load_data(filepath)`

Automatically select the appropriate loader based on the file extension.

Use `pathlib` to create a `Path` object and get the lowercase file extension.

After selecting the appropriate loader, pass the `Path` object (`path`) to that loader rather than passing the original filepath again. `pd.read_csv()` and `open()` can both accept a `Path` object.

For example, the CSV case should call:

```python
load_csv(path)
```

Your function should support the following formats:

| Extension | Loader        | Result        |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `.csv`    | `load_csv()`  | DataFrame     |
| `.json`   | `load_json()` | Python object |
| `.yaml`   | `load_yaml()` | Python object |

For an unsupported file format:

* Log an `ERROR` message.
* Raise a `ValueError`.

Example:

```text
ERROR    Unsupported file format: .txt
```

## Update `pipeline.py`

Update your existing `pipeline.py` so that it uses the new `data_loaders` module. The pipeline should now actually load the input file.

**Task**
1. Import `load_data()` from `data_loaders`.
2. After successful validation, 
    1. Call `load_data()` inside a `try` block and store the returned value in a variable called `data`.
    2. Catch `ValueError` in an `except` block and exit the program using `sys.exit(1)`.


## Example Output

For a CSV file:

```text
(venv) $ python pipeline.py --input fixtures/sample.csv --output clean.csv --verbose

10:23:01 DEBUG    Arguments parsed: input=fixtures/sample.csv, output=clean.csv format=csv
10:23:01 INFO     Input file validated: fixtures/sample.csv
10:23:01 INFO     Loaded CSV file: fixtures/sample.csv (5 rows)
```

When a file is missing:

```text
(venv) $ python pipeline.py --input fake.csv --output output.csv

10:23:15 ERROR    Input file not found: fake.csv
```

When an existing file has an unsupported format:

```text
(venv) $ python pipeline.py --input pipeline.py --output output.csv

10:24:03 ERROR    Unsupported file format: .py
```
## After completing Part 2

Your repository should contain:

```text
mp1-data-pipeline/
├── .gitignore
├── pipeline.py
├── data_loaders.py
├── requirements.txt
└── fixtures/
    ├── sample.csv
    ├── sample.json
    └── sample.yaml
```

Make sure that:

* `pipeline.py` continues to work after integrating the data loaders.
* Appropriate logging levels are used for successful loads and errors.
* All changes are committed to Git.
* Once completed, your feature branch is merged into `main`.
* The final `main` branch contains your completed Part 2 work.
* Your completed work is pushed to GitHub.
